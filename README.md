# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Rujan**, a web developer based in Nepal.

I build stuff for the web, mostly backend these days, but I can handle the full stack when needed.

If I think it's cool, I'll probably build it. If it involves blockchain or some wild new tech, even better.

My main tech stack is **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **PayloadCMS**, **Django**, and I've dabbled in **blockchain** (built a project on Ethereum with Solidity). My go-to languages are **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**.

I'm currently a final year **BCS CSIT student**, which means I'm juggling code, coffee, and deadlines.

I've got a bunch of projects scattered around here, but my favorite is probably the [**Blockchain Project**](https://github.com/Rujan0833/Blockchain-Project) I worked on with my friends. That was a blast.

If you want to see what I've been up to or learn more about my work, check out my [**portfolio**](https://rujanrajlawat.com.np)!
